# Math-Analysis-2019
This is a collection of codes that I wrote during my Fall 2019 quarter at UCSB.
During this course I learned how to visualize data points and to map approximations
  that try to convey the direction the data points are going.
I used Jupyter Notebook as it was useful in answering theoretical questions and analytical questions in one file.
